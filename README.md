### DAY 1


The first project is a special map of my community. Though seems like a metro map, it is actually  a map which illustrated the routes of different kinds of cars and different people. The starting point of making this project is that one day I noticed all kinds of vehicles have a relatively fixed route here because of the regulation of the community. For instance, motor vehicles are only allowed to drive in the 4 arch loop roads, which is the outermost part of the ‘traffic system’ of community, while the cleaner cars only clean the on those main roads which diverging from the middle area. For people walking in the community, those routes are more random and unpredictable, but there are also some common rules for it. The rule of dogs not allowing to go to the center OVAL part and the location of the sunbath area form the routes of dog-walking and sunbath. 

All of those regulations make up a fun system which is a little bit similar to a real traffic system. Every train has a fixed path in metro system, and they also meets and separate in some specific stations. Then I decided to turn my little observation into a real ‘metro map’. After doing some research on New York Metro especially about the icon system, color and typography, I found it would be fun to make my community map just look like the NY Metro system visually. And here is my final work in illustration. The ‘trains’ are always under construction, so I may add more trains after finding interesting routes. ( I still have no idea how to define this project, compared with illustration or info-graphic it is more like representing some little observations for me.)



### DAY 2


After finished the last project, I realized that there are so many fun things I can explore even in a small community. I started to collect some special stuffs near my home, and I got some little stones, fallen leaves and a express waybill. They are fun materials but not what I need for my projects. Finally what I got was some audio from different places in the community. Because those audio sounds really different depends on the place you are. If you record it near the fountain, it will sounds like heavy rain, and the voice near my home where surrounded by many trees is more gentle and quiet.

It is really fun to find that there is a special ‘voice identity’ for every single places. Those subtle differences make a place special. As the execution part, I originally planned to make the identity for those places, but the technical problem about voice visualization make it hard to finish in one day. As a result, I just choose to use the processing to draw some sound waves to show the different voice identity of places. Two typical places( fountain and trees) are chosen to make the project. I used different lightness and scale of the waves to show the difference between different places. Though I am not be able to make a real voice identity in the best way, I am still really interest in the possibility of it. I was wondering if it possible to make a treasure hunt game which use the voice as a hint for the player to find the specific place. I wish I will have appropriate time to try in in next few days or in the future.
